The props I make are meant for use in Daz Studio, they may work in 3D apps which allow OBJ files.

With-in Daz Studio, go to FILE then IMPORT OBJ and load the prop from where you downloaded the file.

If there is a MAT file with the download, Select the prop in Daz Studio and go to File - MERGE and browse to where you stored the prop.

As long as you don't sell what I have made, or try to pass it off as your own work - You can do what ever you want with it.
